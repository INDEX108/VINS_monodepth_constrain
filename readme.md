This repository offers an implementation of the **Monocular Depth Constraint** module, designed to augment the precision of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems by integrating monocular depth estimations as constraints.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Monocular Depth Estimation**: Utilizes cutting-edge algorithms for predicting depth from single images.
- **Seamless Constraint Integration**: Effortlessly merges depth constraints into the VIO optimization workflow.
- **Improved Scale Consistency**: Addresses the scale drift issues inherent to visual odometry systems.
- **Enhanced Navigation Precision**: Boosts the accuracy of navigation through additional geometric constraints.

For the loopback part of the framework, please refer to the open source work of the author kajo-kurisu. https://github.com/kajo-kurisu/D_VINS.
To integrate the Monocular Depth Constraint module with your VIO system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/index108/Monocular-Depth-Constraint.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. See `requirements.txt` for the full list.

3. **Configure Parameters**: Adapt the parameters in `config.py` to align with your specific VIO system configuration.

4. **Integrate with VIO**: Incorporate the depth constraint module into your VIO optimization pipeline.

5. **Run Optimization**: Execute the VIO system with the integrated depth constraints.

6. **Evaluate Results**: Analyze the results to measure the improvement in accuracy.

## Usage

The Monocular Depth Constraint module is designed for easy integration with existing VIO systems:

- **Depth Estimation**: Apply a pre-trained model to estimate depth from keyframe images.
- **Constraint Formulation**: Transform estimated depths into optimization constraints.
- **Optimization**: Use these constraints within the VIO system to refine scale and alignment during the optimization process.
